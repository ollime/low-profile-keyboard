Raspberry Pi Pico MCU

Possible features to look into?\
75% or 65% layout?\
Bluetooth
 
Still a work in progress. Next time I need to figure out the keyboard layout & start working on the PCB schematic.


## 6/26 Creating the layout
time spent: 2 hours

I used https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/ to create a reference for creating the schematic:

![Initial keyboard layout](layout-1.png)

Since I went with a staggered layout, I used https://www.keyboard.university/100-courses/keyboard-sizes-layouts-gdeby to help find common keycap sizes, but I will likely have to make changes to this later when I find a keycap set. I saved the .json file so I can modify the layout later.

switches needed: 70\
row 0: 15\
row 1: 16\
row 2: 14\
row 3: 14\
row 4: 11
